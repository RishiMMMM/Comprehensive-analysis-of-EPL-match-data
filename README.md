# Comprehensive-analysis-of-EPL-match-data
## Project Overview

This project explores the predictive power of machine learning in analyzing English Premier League (EPL) football matches, aiming to enhance strategic decision-making and improve game outcomes. By harnessing a rich dataset compiled from multiple seasons, we engage in detailed exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and machine learning model development.
